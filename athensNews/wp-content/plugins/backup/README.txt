<h4>A special note on WordPress migration</h4>

A WordPress site migration is an easy task if performed properly. There are three different migration scenarios:
<ul>
<li>Migrate site from a subdirectory of a domain to the root directory</li>
<li>Migrate site from a local installation to a remote installation</li>
<li>Migrate site between domains or hosts</li>
</ul>

Backup Guard Pro helps you to migrate in all of these cases in the smoothest possible way. You just have to Backup your site and Restore it in the new location. No additional work will be required, since we handle all changes for you.

The issues that users always deal with are: wrong site url, images don't load, dashboard not accessible, permalinks don't work and more.

Backup Guard Pro will help you to skip all these problems, because of its advanced refactoring and migrating engine.
